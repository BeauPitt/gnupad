#| This configuration file should bring a Notepad-like behavior to Nano.
#|
#| Not implemented yet:
#|   * Ctrlt+arrows caret movements
#|   * Shift+arrows selection mode
#|     (=> use the Emacs-like Ctrl+Space marker instead)
#|   * Shift+[F3] (= previous search occurrences)
#|
#| References:
#|   * man nanorc
#|   * /usr/share/doc/nano/examples/nanorc.sample.gz (or equivalent)
